I liked the overall concept of the book to bring light to struggles of Dalit in India to achieve success, But morally I didn’t agree with glorification of Hospital and education as a business.\nOne of the major take away from the book is that almost all of the 15 Millionaires had an ally in one way or the other to help them to get started. Basically, in my opinion Allies are more important in upbringing of suppressed people lives.\nThe writing style of the stories is very simple and easy to follow, at the same time the interviews could have been better written.\nNotes  Dalit Millionaires by Milind_Khandekar ISBN: 9780143420828 (goodreads, Publisher) Published: Dec/2013 Read: 2020/06/13  ","description":"","tags":["books","review"],"title":"Dalit Millionaires by Milind Khandekar","uri":"/reading/dalit-millionaires/"},{"categories":["books","review"],"content":"Rating ⭐ ⭐ ⭐\nIt is a collection of stories from Mrs.Sudha Murthy’s life and her work in Infosys foundation. This book is very good for short intermittent reads because of the way it was written, each chapter is a standalone chapter without much interaction with others. The writing style is very simple and easy to follow at the same time it checked all the boxes for a good read.\nThe book starts with the reason behind the name three thousand stitches and ends with a positive note in an AA group meeting. Whether it is about using the new office building money to bring back stranded women back to home country or being the only women in the engineering college or leaving saree shopping in kasi all the stories had some instances which touches a spot.\nLoved the style of writing, very fast read however the book doesn’t talk much about the ordinary people or their extraordinary lives much, it more of a authors perspective and her experiences with those people. Revolves mostly around author and her infosys trust.\nNotes  Three Thousand Stitches: Ordinary People, Extraordinary Lives by Sudha Murty ISBN: 9780143440055 (goodreads, Publisher) Published: Jul/2017 Read: 2020/06/23  ","description":"","tags":["books","review"],"title":"Three Thousand Stitches: Ordinary People, Extraordinary Lives by Sudha Murty","uri":"/reading/three-thousand-stitches/"},{"categories":["coffee","review"],"content":"Coffee Continuation of the blue tokai french roast coffee review, in this edition I will be talking about a new brewing method the best so far for this coffee. The difference in this type of brewing is the time water takes to interact with the finely ground coffee, with pour over brewing the interaction between water and coffee is kept to the minimum. Due to that the aroma of the coffee is well preserved in this brew.\nRecipe Take necessary cups ( 1 cup ~ 250ml) of water in a pot, heat it until it boils, let it sit for 1-2min, take a strainer, add 1 tablespoon of coffee grounds per cup in the strainer, put the strainer on top of the cup and pour the hot water over the coffee grounds slowly. Fill the cup and serve hot.\nThoughts With the pour brew I got the best results so far in terms of taste, aroma, boldness and strength. With this brew I got the perfect strength of the coffee with perfect aroma, the taste of the coffee is not watered down instead it was very bold and strong. The main draw back I had with this brew is the mesh size of my strainer, which was not fine enough to filter all the coffee grounds, so there was a lot of sediments in the bottom of the cup. In the next iteration I should add coffee filter paper on top of the strainer and brew the coffee, with this addition there should be a drop in the amount of sediments passing through. I will compare this brew with the french press and post the experience once I recieve the frech press from amazon.\n","description":"","tags":["coffee","blue tokai","french roast","review","pour over"],"title":"Blue Tokai French Roast Review Pour Over","uri":"/posts/coffee/blue-tokai-french-roast-review-pour-over/"},{"categories":["tamil","politics"],"content":"என் அரசு நான் பசினு கேக்கர முன்னாடி சோறு போடும்; ஊரு வித்து ஊரு வந்து பொழைக்க போரேன்னு சொன்னா ஊருக்கே வந்து பொழப்ப கொடுக்கும்;\nஊரு கிராமம் பிரசவத்துக்கும் ஒடம்பு நோவுக்கும் பத்து மைல் தூரம் போரேன்னு சொன்னா ஊரு தேடி ஆசுபத்திரி வரும் டாக்டரோட சேத்து மருந்தும் வரும்;\nபடிக்க பள்ளிக்கோடம் இல்லை பள்ளிக்கோடம் போன சோத்துக்கு வழியில்லனு சொன்னா பள்ளிக்கோடமும், புஸ்தகமும், சோத்தோட சேந்து வரும், நா படிச்சா போதும்னு;\nசோத்துக்கு வழியில்ல என்ன செய்யனு தெரியல, கவலைய வுடு உன்ற சோத்துக்கு நான் வழி சொல்றேனு, இலவசமா சோத்த மட்டும் போடாம, சோத்துக்கு தேவையான பொழப்பும் தரும்;\nவெவசாயத்துக்கு தண்ணி இல்லனு சொன்னா, கொளவெட்டி கம்மாய் பரிச்சு வந்த மழையெல்லாம் புடுச்சி மூனு போகம் வெளைக்க போக மாடு கன்னுக்கும் கொரவில்லாம தண்ணி தரும்;\nபடாதபாடுபட்டு கடலா வந்த வேர்வைய பாய்ச்சி வெளச்ச பயிருக்கு மொதலாளி சரியா காசு தரலைனா வெளச்சலுக்கு சரியான காசு கொடுத்து வங்குனது மட்டும் இல்லாம மொதலாளியையும் சரியா வாங்க வைக்கும்;\nபடிச்ச படிப்புக்கு உள்னாட்டுல வேலை இல்ல நா வெளினாட்டுக்கு போரேன்னு சொன்னா, நீ ஏன் அங்க போய் யெவனுக்கோ ஒழைக்கர உனக்கு நம்ம நாட்லயே வேலைய நாந்தாரன்னு மட்டும் சொல்லாம அத தொடர்ந்து செய்ய வழியும் சொல்லித்தரும்;\nஇப்பிடி நாங்கண்ட கனவெல்லாம் கனவாவே போயுடுமோ? இல்ல அத இந்த சென்மத்துல நனவாக்க வழியாச்சும் கெடச்சிடுமோ?\n","description":"","tags":["tamil","society","politics","dream","தமிழ்","சமூகம்","அரசியல்","கனவு"],"title":"என் அரசு","uri":"/posts/tamil/my-government/"},{"categories":["coffee","review"],"content":"Coffee As a continuation to the blue takoi french roast coffee review, in this post I will be talking more about the refinements made to the brewing process than the coffee itself. As quick introduction to the coffee, it is a blue tokai french roast coffee (i.e) arabica seeds are roasted to the max to get that very dark coffee which has a deep and bold taste. The major change to the recipe is in the timing of adding the coffee grounds to the hot water and the amount of time the coffee is allowed to steep.\nRecipe The french brew recipe is very similar to the lazy brew when it comes to the ingredients and their quantities but very different in the brewing method. Take necessary cups of water in a pot, let it come to boil, stop the heat, let the water sit for 1 to 2 min to lower the temprature so that the coffee will not lose its aroma via steam, add coffee powder 1 table spoon per cup of coffee, stir it well, let it sit for 4-5 minutes depends on how strong you want the coffee, strain and serve.\nThoughts This brew is much better the the last one, it held the aroma better than the lazy brew. It had very good strength and taste, the boldness of the coffee was preserved from the first sip to the last. The one draw back in this method is the coffee ground size, I had the coffee beans ground fine to medium size so even after straining there was good amount of coffee sediment at the bottom of my cup. This issue depressed the taste towards the last sips of the coffee. Also since the coffee has more time to interact with water it produces more bitter coffee than the drip/pour over brews, so this kind of brew is not for everyone. One great charecteristics of this coffee and the brew is it held its boldness when mixed with milk, so to all the coffee lovers who add milk to their coffee you can definetly try this recipe.\nNext step Ordered proper french press from amazon in place of the broken coffee maker, once recived I will post the recipe and the difference between the frech brew and the french press here. Please sit tight until then !!\n","description":"","tags":["coffee","blue tokai","french roast","review","french brew"],"title":"Blue Tokai French Roast Review French Brew","uri":"/posts/coffee/blue-tokai-french-roast-review-french-brew/"},{"categories":["coffee","review"],"content":"Coffee As a coffee lover I love my morning boost of caffine from a well brewed unsweetened black coffee. I used to get this caffine boost from my office coffee machines which ranged from a high quality beans from flying squirrel ground freshly in the office and brewed perfectly as per my taste to a generic espresso spit out by a programmed coffee machine. But this pandemic which caused a lot of trouble to the whole world caused slight inconvinence to my love of coffee. I felt the effect of this during the intial days of lockdown so I ordered my very own personal coffee machine from amazon and awaited its arrival for more than 2 months and finally got it delivered today. Because of the excitement to taste the coffee from my very own coffee machine I ordered 250g of Frech roast coffee from blue tokai ( as a coffee noob ordered the one which I can get the fastest ). But all my excitement for drinking my own coffee went to the drain because of the broken coffee machine I recieved from amazon. I don’t want to accept my defeat, so I did what a sane person will do and went to youtube for advice and voila I realised that you can make coffee without coffee machine. After all this finding I returned my broken coffee maker to amazon and started preparing my very own cup of coffee for the first time.\nRecipe Out of all the recipies I found online I went for the most easiest option available (i.e) get the needed cups of water in a pot, put 1 table spoon of coffee powder for each cup of water, let it boil until the coffee grounds sink to the bottom, take it out of the heat and let it sit for 4 minutes. That is it, just strain it into a cup and you got your cup of coffee for the morning.\nThoughts Right when it was boiling I felt that I am not getting the signature smell of the brewing coffee, the smell which announces that morning is here. Instead i am getting a bland smell or it was like the smell of coffee grounds after the brew is done. So, obviously the way I brewed the coffee is not right but what about the taste of the coffee? The coffee has a peculiar tastes other than what I had before, like this had the taste of water down starbucks pourover coffee. I feel that this coffee has more to offer by refining the brewing method. So tomorrow I am going to try a different brewing method, which is similar to french press but without french press.\n","description":"","tags":["coffee","blue tokai","french roast","review","lazy brew"],"title":"Blue Tokai French Roast Review Lazy Brew","uri":"/posts/coffee/blue-tokai-french-roast-review-lazy-brew/"}]
